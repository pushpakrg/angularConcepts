JIT - Compiles TypeScript just in time for executing it.
  1. Compiled in the browser.
  2. Each file compiled separately.
  3. No need to build after changing your code and before reloading the browser page.
  4. Suitable for local development.
  
AOT - Compiles TypeScript during build phase.
  1. Compiled by the machine itself, via the command line (Faster Rendering).
  2. The Angular compiler extracts the metadata (@Component, @Input etc) once and generates a factory. When it needs to create an instance of it Angular calls the factory.
  2. All code compiled together, inlining HTML/CSS in the scripts.
  3. There's no need to download the Angular compiler if the app is already compiled. The compiler is roughly half of Angular itself, so omitting it dramatically reduces the application payload.
  4. The AOT compiler detects and reports template binding errors during the build step before users can see them.
  5. More secure, original source not disclosed and fewer opportunities for injection attacks.
  6. Suitable for production builds.
