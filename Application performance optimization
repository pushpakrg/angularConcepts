Application performance optimization:
  - AOT compilation
  - bundling and uglifying the application
  - tree shaking
  - lazy loading
  - separating dependencies and devDependencies
  - Using OnPush and TrackBy
  - removing unnecessary 3rd party libraries and import statements
  - avoid computing values within the template
